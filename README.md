# Hardware-Load-Balancing
Load balancing is the problem of assigning virtual machines to servers, which happens at
run-time. As demand changes, virtual machines need to be reassigned so that servers do
not build up a large backlog. One possibility is to use constraint programming for these
problems (Bin et al 2011).
